Notes for assignment 1

First iteration

25 transitions 0.206 transitions
Base 100 transitions 0.789 seconds
1000 transitions 7.844 seconds

'brute force' approach - search the list from start to finish, transition
each element in the list, iff element is conductor then conduct o(n) search
to find all its neighbours.

Immediate improvement - get rid of all the empty cells
Mark 2 results
25 transitions 0.168
100 transitions 0.627
1000 transitions 6.193 seconds

Mark 3 testing - creating a neighbours list and using that rather than scanning the entire world
default bitmap

can i do better???
